# AI Detection Bolt

A real-time AI-powered deepfake detection system for video and audio.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- Python 3.8 or higher
- npm or yarn

### Setup

1. Install JavaScript dependencies:
   ```
   cd aidetection
   npm install
   ```

2. Install Python dependencies:
   ```
   npm run setup:python
   ```

### Text Detection Setup

For text detection functionality, you have two options:

1. **Basic Text Detection** (No additional setup required)
   - Works with just OpenCV
   - Detects potential text regions but doesn't read the text

2. **Full Text Detection with OCR** (Recommended)
   - Run the installation script:
     ```
     cd server
     install_text_detection.bat
     ```
   - Download and install Tesseract OCR from: https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki

### Running the Application

To start both frontend and backend simultaneously:

```
npm run dev
```

This will start:
- Frontend: Vite development server (typically on http://localhost:5173)
- Backend: Express server on http://localhost:3001

### Running Components Separately

To run only the frontend:
```
npm run dev:client
```

To run only the backend:
```
npm run dev:server
```

### System Maintenance

To optimize and clean the system:
```
npm run optimize
```

To run a full cleanup (optimize + lint):
```
npm run clean
```

To check system health:
```
npm run health-check
```

}
```

## üîå Platform Integration

### Google Forms Integration

1. Open Google Forms ‚Üí Script Editor
2. Paste the integration code from the Platform Integration tab
3. Set up form submission trigger
4. Configure teacher email alerts

### Browser Extension

1. Load the extension from `browser-extension/` folder
2. Enable for testing websites
3. Real-time detection on any form submission
4. Visual indicators and alerts

### Webhook Integration

Integrate with any LMS using webhooks:

```javascript
const response = await fetch('http://localhost:3001/api/v1/analyze', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    text: studentResponse,
    studentId: 'student123',
    questionId: 'q1'
  })
});
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with Python package installation:

1. Try installing packages individually:
   ```
   pip install --user opencv-python
   pip install --user numpy
   ```

2. For pytesseract installation issues:
   ```
   pip install --no-deps pytesseract
   pip install pillow
   ```

3. If you see "Failed to write executable" errors, try:
   - Run command prompt as administrator
   - Use the `--user` flag with pip
   - Use the installation batch script provided
